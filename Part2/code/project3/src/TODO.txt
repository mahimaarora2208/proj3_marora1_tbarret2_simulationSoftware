TODO
- Change user input
  + start: x y theta
  + goal: x y 
  + wheel rpms: two possible values for the wheel rpms
  + clearance value
+ Integrate following parameters:
  + robot diameter
  + wheel distance
  + wheel radius
+ New action set:
  + each wheel can spin at either 0, MIN_RPM, or MAX_RPM
  + MIN/MAX are the values the user defined above
  + RPMs must be positive
+ Remove the step size from user input
+ Do forward kinematics to find new position of the robot
  + given the wheel RPMs
  + he gives us this :)
+ The time step will be constant
  + I guess it's technically constant...
- Make sure our units are correct
  - how much does 1 pixel represent?
  - based on that, are our motor inputs reasonable?
